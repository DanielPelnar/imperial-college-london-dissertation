**Abstract**

This paper examines the mispricing determinants of Bitcoin and Ethereum quarterly
futures traded on Binance from February 2021 to June 2022 by employing contract–by–contract regression analysis. Additionally, we consider quadratic form specification
of the regression models to determine whether futures trading volume has a diminishing
effect on the mispricing term (or the basis) and whether a point of maxima
can be found. Finally, we amend the general cost–of–carry model so it does not
treat Bitcoin or Ethereum as a non–dividend paying stock or a zero–coupon bond.
The results suggest that futures volume is the most important explanatory variable
for both Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the estimated coefficients of the quadratic form
specification are statistically significant for 50% and 66% of Bitcoin and Ethereum
contracts respectively. The analysis of the point of maxima suggests that there are 14
days during which Bitcoin underwent a possible market manipulation (for Ethereum,
it was 23 days). Our modification of the cost–of–carry model performs worse than
the benchmark for Bitcoin contracts and better than the benchmark for Ethereum
contracts.
